  I have experience from internships and personal projects ranging from simulation programming using doctoral research to mobile development in React Native and web development. At Sandia, I have quickly learned the ins and outs of Joomla CMS, a plugin for Joomla called Flexicontent (an advanced content management system), PHP, JQuery/AJAX, and MySQL querying. I improved upon the OneStop websiteâ€™s existing method of reusing content and editing reusable content from the front-end. With my improvements, administrative content creators are easily and efficiently able to go to the source of reused content and see where content is being used in other locations without going into the back-end administration portal. It can be effortlessly included in existing templates without error.  I also made a dynamic search table where I honed these programming skills. Finally, I thoroughly documented my work so other developers can easily understand what I have done and quickly make changes and/or improvements.

  I have spent significant time tinkering in React-Native when using it while on a research team that aimed to create an app that crowdsources data from disaster areas and by creating quick projects (like a Pomodoro Timer and an app that dynamically loads content from a movie API). Additionally, my team and I made a Covid Counter Web App at TAMUHack that used Tensorflow/openCV for detecting people moving in and out of an entryway.
   I work through conceptual obstacles with a great deal of self research and by asking relevant and specific questions. As a result, I am a very quick and motivated learner. Other interests include service, fitness, piano, and animation.
