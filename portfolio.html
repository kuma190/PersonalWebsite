    <h1>Covid Counter</h1>
    <h2>TAMUHack 2021</h2>
    <p>Project related to adhering to COVID building restrictions made in under 24 hours that used Tensorflow openCV for object detection and an algorithm which could keep count of people entering and exiting an entryway
      Used HTML/CSS/Javascript for Frontend, Flask and Node.js for backend, Firebase for data storage.</p>

    <h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>
    <p>June 2020</p>
    <p>Just a little thing to get my feet wet in React Native. It was interesting to research how to pass data between components and make a plausible design</p>

    <h1> Simulating Crowd Evacuation Using the Minority Game </h1>
    <p>August 2018</p>
    <p>The code is simulating crowd evacuation management using Stochastic Learning Automata and the Minority Game sequentially. Stochastic Learning Automata is centralized, meaning that in order to operate, it requires information about how the users are interacting with the environment. It organizes users into their optimal escape route cluster, which the minority game acts on. The minority game is distributed, making it much simpler in its function, and therefore faster. The minority game simply broadcasts whether the target group was under the threshold value. The users of the go and not go group update the strategy accordingly. When the threshold for convergence is high, the minority game ensures that the target group population is less than or equal to the preset threshold. When the convergence needed to exit the minority game is low, users in routes can exceed capacity and decrease the quote of service of that route. Ultimately, routes can become more distinguished in their effectiveness to manage crowd evacuation when the minority game is quicker and less effective, simulating real life conditions. Information crucial to users making better decisions is updated after the minority game, and the number of iterations needed for all the users to evacuate the critical area is recorded.
